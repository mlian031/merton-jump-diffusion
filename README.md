# Merton Jump Diffusion Model

This program aims to implement a simulation of Merton's jump-diffusion model at fixed-dates,
as presented in Paul Glasserman's "Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering" (2003,
Chapter 3.5).The model accounts for both continuous diffusion and discrete jumps in asset prices.
